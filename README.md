# Chrome Epic UserWeb Search Extension

Do you want to directly search Epic's galaxy without having to wait for the galaxy screen to load?  This extension allows you to do exactly that.  Simply type 'uw' followed by a space and your search term in Chrome's Omnibox and your query will be sent directly to galaxy.  Need to search Sherlock?  Simply type 'uw sherlock' followed by a space and your search term in the Omnibox and your query will go to Sherlock.
